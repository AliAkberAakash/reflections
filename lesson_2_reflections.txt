# What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

> A .git file is created. 
> I need it to keep doing git operations like commit, log, status etc.

# How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

> In this area we have prepared a screenshot of all the files but haven't commited yet. It is not 
> the real file directory but only the preparation. It offers us to commit files on different 
> commits, it helps us to seperate them.
